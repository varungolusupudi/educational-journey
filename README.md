# Educational Journey - Interactive Storytelling Website

Built with React and Tailwind CSS, this project combines narrative storytelling with modern web technologies to create an engaging and reflective experience.

## Themes Explored

- **Tracking**: Examining the impact of educational sorting and labeling
- **Fugitivity**: Finding spaces of resistance and alternative paths
- **Liberation**: Reclaiming agency in learning through technology
- **Marginalization**: Understanding and challenging systemic barriers
- **Transformative Learning**: Education as a tool for personal and social change

## Technical Features

- Smooth parallax scrolling effects
- Interactive animations using Framer Motion
- Particle system backgrounds
- Typewriter text effects
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- SVG illustrations
- Modern gradient overlays
